<h3 data-start="816" data-end="863">The Meaning and Purpose of Quran Recitation</h3>
<p data-start="865" data-end="1220">Reciting the Quran is a unique act of worship. It requires correct articulation, disciplined practice, and sincere devotion. Unlike ordinary reading, Quran recitation is guided by rules that preserve the sacred pronunciation and rhythm passed down from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The purpose extends beyond vocal practice; it is a means to:</p>
<ul data-start="1222" data-end="1410">
<li data-start="1222" data-end="1266">
<p data-start="1224" data-end="1266">Strengthen faith and spiritual awareness</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1267" data-end="1312">
